Hi User.

In order to use this program first you have to open the MainExcel.xlsm file. 
Open the 'Paths' Sheet and check the various setting first.  Those settings are critical for application to run.
Carefully read the description of each setting and set the value accordingly(before making changes please take the backup). 
This application expects few folders.
	Configuration Folder and two files(.def and .lof) for each feed.
	Source folder from where rar file is available. (Same will be set in Paths sheet for application to pick).

Once all files are available in the above said folders and necessary setting are done in Paths sheet, we are all set.

Thats all. Happy using the app.
